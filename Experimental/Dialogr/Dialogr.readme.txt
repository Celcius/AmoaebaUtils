Dialogr is a Twine integration for unity

This system was started by taking strong inspiration on

1. Write your file using Twine
2. Save your .Twee file as .txt
3. Right-Click on the project and select Create > Dialogr > Load Twine to Dialogr Scene Scriptable
4. Select your .Twee file in the Wizard
4.1 You can set your own settings for importing here
4. Select the folder to export to

Additionally you can quickly reload your .twee file by right-clicking one or more Scene Scriptables
and selecting "Reload Dialogr .Twee Assets". 
> Note that this only works if the twee file is still the same.

Some Nomenclature:
* Speech Scene
A scene is the entirety of a .twee file and all of its Speech Nodes

A scene must have a start node.

* Speech Nodes
A Conversation Node in Twine.
It is understood as having:
Options to transition to other Speech Nodes.
Tags which can be used to mark up the conversation
MetaActions which are Tags that can have values.

* Option
These are jumps between Speech Nodes

Options are exported as [[ and ]], so normal text cannot have these special characters

Our Basic Window Example uses empty single Options as an automatic transition between 
Speech Nodes without creating buttons

* Tags
These are Twine-based markups
MetaActions are extracted from Tags but are considered separately

* Meta Actions 
These are special tags that can have values to instruct the game of how to present the text

By default these come in the format !Key:Value1:Value2:...
It can have as many values as needed but it needs at least one.

An example is !character:Boss, where it indicates a character of value Boss is communicating.

Ultimately Dialogr does not enforce what MetaActions do, and its up to each project to define and interpret them.
